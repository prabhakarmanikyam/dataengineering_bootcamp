# LINKEDIN’S KPI AND EXPERIMENTATION

I have been an active LinkedIn user for over 6 years. As a professional, I rely on LinkedIn to expand my network, showcase my skills, and discover job opportunities. Back when I started using LinkedIn, it was primarily a place to keep an online resume. Over time, it evolved into a platform where I could learn from thought leaders, join industry discussions, and follow companies I admire. I enjoy LinkedIn’s clean interface, relevant job recommendations, and the way it keeps me connected to my professional community.

One of my favorite features is LinkedIn Learning — it allows me to upskill without leaving the platform. I also appreciate seeing posts from my connections about career milestones and professional tips. However, I’ve noticed that the feed sometimes shows irrelevant content or overly promotional posts, and connection requests can feel impersonal.

With competition from platforms like X (Twitter) and niche networking apps, LinkedIn needs to keep its content high-quality and its networking more personal to maintain loyalty. For this reason, I would run the following three experiments to improve my experience and engagement.

## Experiment 1: AI-Powered Connection Note to Improve Acceptance Rates
**Objective:** Many connection requests feel generic and lack personalization. This experiment tests whether adding an AI-suggested personalized note based on shared work history, education, or mutual connections increases connection acceptance rates.

**Null Hypothesis:** AI-generated personalized notes do not significantly improve connection acceptance rates compared to default requests without a note.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** AI-generated personalized notes significantly improve connection acceptance rates compared to default requests without a note.

**Leading Metric:** Connection acceptance rate within 7 days of sending the request.

**Lagging Metric:** Percentage of accepted connections that lead to at least one message exchange within 30 days.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50% Control (no note), 50% Treatment (AI-suggested note).

## Experiment 2: Topic + Creator Follow Module to Improve Feed Relevance
**Objective:** New users often have an unpersonalized feed at first. This experiment tests whether showing a module that suggests topics and credible creators to follow improves engagement with feed content.

**Null Hypothesis:** The Topic + Creator Follow module does not significantly improve engagement with feed content compared to the current onboarding flow.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The Topic + Creator Follow module significantly improves engagement with feed content compared to the current onboarding flow.

**Leading Metric:** Number of quality feed actions (likes, comments, shares, saves) within the first 14 days.

**Lagging Metric:** Four-week retention rate of new users.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50% Control (current onboarding), 50% Treatment (Topic + Creator Follow module).

## Experiment 3: Guided First Message to Improve Conversation Rates
**Objective:** After a connection is accepted, many conversations never start. This experiment tests whether showing first-message templates (customized to the connection’s background) increases the likelihood of meaningful conversation.

**Null Hypothesis:** Guided first-message templates do not significantly increase the percentage of new connections that result in a conversation.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Guided first-message templates significantly increase the percentage of new connections that result in a conversation.

**Leading Metric:** Percentage of new connections that have at least one message sent within 72 hours of acceptance.

**Lagging Metric:** Percentage of conversations that continue beyond three messages within 14 days.

**Test Cell Allocation:** 50% Control (no templates), 50% Treatment (guided message templates).
